Hello, I am BotLogger. I Would save your message on group.
But I didn't have much resource for that. So, I could save only 1000 messages.
I could save files (such as images, files, audios, etc) too... (unavailable right now).
I have some command to execute :
/leave to leave from group
/active to show how much readers from the last message (unavailable)
/msgShow HH:mm-HH:mm to show the message from the HH:mm to HH:mm (HH:Hours, mm:minutes)
/file #id to get file from #id
You could use them to make me do a thing.
Thank you to read this message. I only support for group or roomchat. Just invite me in and I will help you.

Happy Logging!
